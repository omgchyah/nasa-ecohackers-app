💻 Technologies Used

    Backend: Spring Boot 🛠️, Java ☕, Maven
    Frontend: Angular ⚡, TypeScript
    Database: MySQL 🗄️ (configurable for other databases)

✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before proceeding:

    Java JDK (version 17 or higher) ☕
    Node.js (version 14 or higher) 🟢
    Angular CLI (globally installed) ⚡
    Maven (version 3.6 or higher) 🛠️
    MySQL (or other relational database) 🗄️

🛠️ Installation
🗂️ Clone the Repository

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository

Backend Setup (Spring Boot) ⚙️

    Navigate to the backend directory:

bash

cd backend

    Install dependencies and build the project:

bash

mvn clean install

    Database Configuration:
    Edit src/main/resources/application.properties to configure your MySQL database:

properties

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

    Run the Spring Boot application:

bash

mvn spring-boot:run

The backend server will start at http://localhost:8080.
Frontend Setup (Angular) ⚡

    Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash

cd frontend

    Install dependencies:

bash

npm install

    Run the Angular development server:

bash

ng serve

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:4200.
🌐 Connecting Frontend to Backend

Ensure the frontend API requests point to the backend's server URL in src/environments/environment.ts:

typescript

export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8080/api'
};

🚀 Running the Application

    Start the Backend:
    Follow the steps in Backend Setup.

    Start the Frontend:
    Follow the steps in Frontend Setup.

    Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200.

❗ Common Issues

    Port Conflicts:
    If ports 8080 (backend) or 4200 (frontend) are in use, change the ports:
        Spring Boot: Edit application.properties and change server.port=8081.
        Angular: Run ng serve --port 4201.

    CORS Issues:
    Ensure CORS is configured in your Spring Boot backend by adding appropriate headers or using @CrossOrigin annotations.
